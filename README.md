MultEdu

Source of the MultEdu lecture preparation in LaTeX.

The material provided here is used to prepare teaching material.
I personally use it in university courses, but also good for making
presentations for conferences, and even writing thesis.

A serious challenge, mainly if the subject of course develops quickly,
to provide visually attractive, valuable content material, in various
presentation forms. The present package has two basic output forms:
books for reading and slides for presenting. Both outputs are finalized
in PDF files, and their source is LaTeX/beamer. Because of the need for
making slides, the text basically is organized  in units of beamer frames,
and beamerarticle is used to produce the book-like formats. Of course,
the content of the output files is different: the slides contain
mainly figures, short explanations (enough for the lecturer to make
the course) and the books contain many extra information, told at
the lectures and readable only in the book output. Some macros support
separating the text in this way, because the source file in LaTeX is the same.
This, however, needs special considerations from the author: the text
must be undestandable both in slide and book form. The presence of the
figures needs special attention in formatting, and also means some
limitations: the output must be tolarable at all potential output forms.

The books appear basically in three different forms: printable book (A4 size),
WEB browsable book and book for mobile devices.
